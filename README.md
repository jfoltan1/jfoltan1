# 👋 Ahoj! I'm Július Foltán

🔧 Embedded Software Engineer | C/C++ | ESP32 | Real-Time Systems

I'm a hands-on embedded developer with a passion for low-level programming, real-time data, and writing efficient firmware that runs close to the metal. My journey blends deep C/C++ experience with practical leadership in technical operations — from bare-metal development on microcontrollers to building tools that interact directly with hardware.
I've studied with the 42 Network,learning on a project-to-project basis.

- Interprets CAN messages (ISO 11898) and displays live telemetry on a custom readout interface.
- Designed for modularity and easy integration into custom dashboards.

### 🐚 Minishell – Custom Unix Shell
- Built a fully functional shell in C from scratch.
- Supported redirections, signals, pipes, and environment variable expansion.
- Deep dive into low-level Unix system calls and terminal control.

### 🌄 FdF – 3D Wireframe Renderer
- Used Bresenham’s algorithm to project 2D height maps into interactive 3D models.
- Optimized for real-time rendering and large data sets using matrix math and pointer-level optimizations.

###	And many more! Check my repos 😉
